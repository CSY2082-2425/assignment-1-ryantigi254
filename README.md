# README

## Introduction

This project analyzes housing sales data for a large U.S. estate agent. The goal is to clean and explore the dataset, visualize key insights, and develop machine learning models to improve the company's business operations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Weekly Tasks**: Contains task files, progress reports, and outputs for each week.
   - Location: `Weekly Tasks` folder
   - Contents: `Task [Number].ipynb` files, weekly progress reports, `models` subfolder, visualization outputs

2. **AI Assisted Code**: Documents the AI-assisted development process.
   - Location: `AI Assisted Code` folder
   - Key files: Brief report on AI use, `Task [Number] AI assisted.ipynb`

3. **Main Analysis**: Primary analysis and modeling tasks.
   - Location: Root directory
   - Files: `Task [Number].ipynb`

4. **Additional Resources**: Assignment details and revision notes.
   - Location: Root directory

## How to Navigate the Project

1. Start with the `Weekly Tasks` folder for a chronological overview of the project's progress.
2. Explore the main task files in the root directory for detailed analysis and modeling.
3. Check the `AI Assisted Code` folder for insights into the development process and AI contributions.
4. Review the revision notes in the root directory for additional context and explanations.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.12.5
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

3. **Setting up the Project**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
   - Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required packages in the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Running the Notebooks with Jupyter**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the project folder and open the desired `.ipynb` file.
   - Execute cells sequentially to see the results.

5. **Alternative: Using an IDE**:
   - If preferred, you can use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or Spyder.
   - Open the `.ipynb` files in your IDE's notebook interface.
   - For VSCode, install the "Jupyter" extension.
   - For PyCharm, ensure you have the "DataSpell" plugin or use the built-in notebook support.
   - Execute cells sequentially to see the results.

6. **Important Note on File Paths**:
   - Be aware that file paths used in the notebooks (especially in `testing.ipynb`, `task1.ipynb`, `task2.ipynb`, and `regression 1.ipynb`) may need to be adjusted to match the paths on your local device.
   - Ensure that you update these paths before running the notebooks to avoid any file not found errors.
   - HTML versions of the notebooks are provided in the main tasks folder, showing the last most up-to-date run conducted.

## Branching Strategy

We use a `development` branch for active development and a `testing` branch for validation before merging into the main branch.

## Additional Information

- A 5-minute demo video is included to showcase the project's workflow and key findings.
- Regular updates have been committed to the GitHub repository throughout the development process.
