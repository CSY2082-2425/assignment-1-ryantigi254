# README

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing housing sales data for a large U.S. estate agent. The goal is to clean and explore the dataset, visualize key insights, and develop machine learning models to help improve the company's business operations.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**: We start by examining the dataset to understand the current housing market. This includes creating visualizations to highlight trends and patterns that could be valuable to the client.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values and reformatting data where necessary to prepare it for modeling.

- **Regression Model**: A model is built to predict house prices based on various features. The model's performance is evaluated using a train/test split.

- **Clustering and Classification**:
  - **Clustering**: We determine the optimal number of specialized teams (such as luxury, affordable, budget) by grouping houses based on price points.
  - **Classification Model**: A model is developed to assign new houses to the appropriate team. This model is also evaluated using a train/test split.

- **Recommendations**: We suggest additional data that could further improve the models and develop a prototype if possible.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment
   - Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

2. **Installation**:
   - Install the necessary libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run each cell in order to execute the code and see the results.

## Branching Strategy

To manage iterative development and testing of various models and use cases, we've implemented a branching strategy using `testing` and `development` branches:

- **Development Branch**: This is where new features and models are developed. It's the main working branch where code is actively being written and updated.

- **Testing Branch**: Once changes in the development branch are ready, they are merged into the testing branch. Here, we perform various tests to ensure that the models and code behave as expected.

This approach allows us to iteratively improve the models while maintaining a stable codebase. It also makes it easier to track changes and revert if necessary.

## Demo Video

A 5-minute demo video is included, showcasing the project's workflow and key findings. Please ensure you have access to view the video.

## Project Updates

Regular updates have been committed to the GitHub repository throughout the development process. A screenshot of the commit history is included in the notebook to provide evidence of ongoing work.
